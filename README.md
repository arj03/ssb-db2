# SSB-DB2

SSB-DB2 is a new database for secure-scuttlebutt, it is meant as a
replacement for [ssb-db]. The main reason for creating a new database
is to be able to rework some of the existing decisions without having
to be 100% backwards compatible. The main reasons are:

 - Performance, the database stores data in [bipf]
 - Replace flume with [jitdb] and specialized indexes
 - Run in the browser
 - Work well with partial replication

SSB-DB2 is a secret-stack plugin that registers itself in the db
namespace.

By default SSB-DB2 only loads a base index (indexes/base), this index
includes the basic functionality for getting messages from the log and
for doing EBT.

By default the database is stored in ~/.ssb/db2/log.bipf and indexes
are stored in ~/.ssb/db2/indexes/.

## Usage

To get the post messages of a specific author, you can do:

```js
const SecretStack = require('secret-stack')
const caps = require('ssb-caps')
const {and, type, author, toCallback} = require('ssb-db2/operators')

const sbot = SecretStack({appKey: caps.shs})
  .use(require('ssb-db2'))
  .call(null, {})

sbot.db.query(
  and(type('post')),
  and(author('@6CAxOI3f+LUOVrbAl0IemqiS7ATpQvr9Mdw9LC4+Uv0=.ed25519')),
  toCallback((err, msgs) => {
    console.log('There are ' + msgs.length + ' messages of type "post" from arj')
    sbot.close()
  })
)
```

An extra index plugin that is commonly needed in SSB communities is the `mentions` index. It has one method:

 - getMessagesByMention

This plugin is meant as an example for application developers to write
their own plugins if the functionality of JITDB is not enough. JITDB
is good for indexing specific values, like type `post`, whereas for
root messages where there are a lot of keys and only a few results for
each, a specialized index makes more sense.

To get the post messages that mention Alice, you can do:

```js
const SecretStack = require('secret-stack')
const caps = require('ssb-caps')
const {query, and, type, author, toCallback} = require('ssb-db2/operators')
const mentions = require('ssb-db2/operators/mentions')

const sbot = SecretStack({appKey: caps.shs})
  .use(require('ssb-db2'))
  .use(require('ssb-db2/mentions')) // include index
  .call(null, {})

sbot.db.query(
  and(mentions(alice.id), type('post')),
  toCallback((err, msgs) => {
    console.log('There are ' + msgs.length + ' messages')
    sbot.close()
  })
)
```

SSB DB2 includes a couple of plugins for backwards compatibility,
including legacy replication, ebt and publish. They can be loaded as:

```js
const SecretStack = require('secret-stack')

const sbot = SecretStack({appKey: caps.shs})
  .use(require('ssb-db2'))
  .use(require('ssb-db2/compat')) // include all compatibility plugins
  .call(null, {})
```

or specifically:

```js
const SecretStack = require('secret-stack')

const sbot = SecretStack({appKey: caps.shs})
  .use(require('ssb-db2'))
  .use(require('ssb-db2/compat/db')) // basic db compatibility
  .use(require('ssb-db2/compat/history-stream')) // legacy replication
  .use(require('ssb-db2/compat/ebt')) // ebt db helpers
  .call(null, {})
```

## Migrating from ssb-db

The flumelog used underneath ssb-db2 is different than that one in ssb-db, this means we need to scan over the old log and copy all messages onto the new log, if you wish to use ssb-db2 to make queries.

ssb-db2 comes with migration methods built-in, you can enable them (they are off by default!) in your config file (or object):

```js
const SecretStack = require('secret-stack')

const config = {
  keys: keys,
  db2: {
    automigrate: true
  }
}

const sbot = SecretStack({appKey: caps.shs})
  .use(require('ssb-db2'))
  .use(require('ssb-db2/compat'))
  .call(null, config)
```

The above script will initiate migration as soon as the plugins are loaded. If you wish the manually dictate when the migration starts, don't use the `automigrate` config above, instead, call the `migrate.start()` method yourself:

```js
sbot.db.migrate.start()
```

Note, it is acceptable to load both ssb-db and ssb-db2 plugins, the system will still function correctly and migrate correctly:

```js
const sbot = SecretStack({appKey: caps.shs})
  .use(require('ssb-db'))
  .use(require('ssb-db2'))
  .use(require('ssb-db2/compat'))
  .call(null, config)
```

However, note that while the old log exists, it will be continously migrated to the new log, and ssb-db2 forbids you to use its database-writing APIs such as `add()`, `publish()`, `del()` and so forth, to prevent the two logs from diverging into inconsistent states. The old log will remain the source of truth and keep getting copied into the new log, until the old log file does not exist anymore.

### Migrating without including ssb-db2

Because ssb-db2 also begins indexing basic metadata once it's included as a plugin, this may cost more (precious) CPU time. **If you are not yet using db2 APIs** but would like to migrate the log anyway, in preparation for later activating db2, then you can include only the migration plugin, like this:

```js
const sbot = SecretStack({appKey: caps.shs})
  .use(require('ssb-db2/migrate'))
  .call(null, config)
```

Note that the `start` behavior is the same: you can either start it automatically using `config.db2.automigrate` or manually like this:

```js
sbot.db2migrate.start()
```
